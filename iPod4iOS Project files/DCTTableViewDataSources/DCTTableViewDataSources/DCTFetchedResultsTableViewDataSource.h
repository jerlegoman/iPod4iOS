 You can set this up in a number of ways:
 
 - Provide a fetchedResultsController
 - Provide a managedObjectContext and a fetchRequest
 - Provide a managedObjectContext and a fetchRequestBlock
 - Implement loadFetchedResultsController in a subclass
 - Provide a managedObjectContext and implement loadFetchRequest in a subclass
 
 There may be other combinations that work also. Note however that without 
 a managed object context and some form of fetch request, this will crash.
