h1. DCTTableViewDataSources

DCTTableViewDataSources are a more structured way of making an object to use as a data source for a UITableView.

h2. Features

* Automatic handling of table view cells created from nibs or a storyboard
* A fetched results data source that can be fed with a managed object context and fetch request to keep the table view in sync.
* A splitter data source that can be used to join multiple data source objects together
* Data source to represent one object, useful if you want to join a couple of different types of cell representing different objects
* A collapsable data source which provides a header cell, which opens and collapses its children when tapped

h2. iOS 5 and Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)

This project uses ARC, but will work fine with iOS 4.3-style ARC. 

It will also work fine when compiled to use iOS 4.3 as the base SDK. When doing so, the new iOS 5 call (@registerNib:forCellReuseIdentifier:@ on UITableView) is not used. If you use the DCTTableViewDataSource implementation of @tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:@ in data source subclasses, it will yield no ill effect and still give you the nib-based table cell.

h2. Example

This will create a table view with a cell to use as a button to add a timestamp and list all the timestamps below it. This is shown in the MasterViewController in the project in the *demo* branch.

bc.. splitDataSource = [[DCTSplitTableViewDataSource alloc] init];
splitDataSource.type = DCTSplitTableViewDataSourceTypeSection;

addingDataSource = [[DCTObjectTableViewDataSource alloc] init];
addingDataSource.object = @"Add new timestamp";
[splitDataSource addChildTableViewDataSource:addingDataSource];

DCTFetchedResultsTableViewDataSource *fetchedResultsDS = [[DCTFetchedResultsTableViewDataSource alloc] init];
fetchedResultsDS.cellClass = [EventTableViewCell class];
fetchedResultsDS.managedObjectContext = self.managedObjectContext;
fetchedResultsDS.fetchRequest = request; // Just some request
[splitDataSource addChildTableViewDataSource:fetchedResultsDS];

self.tableView.dataSource = splitDataSource;

h2. Branch Structure

There are two branches to this repository, *master* and *demo*.

h3. master

The master branch contains the code and should be used if you want to add these extensions as a git submodule in other projects. It will only contain the class files themselves without the Xcode project or example classes. This is preferable as it will keep your directories clean of any code which is unnecessary to your working project.

To add this project as a submodule you should run the following from inside your project's git repository:

bc. git submodule add git://github.com/danielctull/DCTTableViewDataSources.git

To keep up to date with the latest changes `cd` into the directory that contains this submodule and pull the newest changes as usual:

bc. git pull origin

h3. demo

This contains an Xcode project that demonstrates the code and is the branch to use to see how to use the code. The demo branch contains a submodule reference to the master branch to bring in the library classes.

To clone the demo branch, while also pulling in any necessary submodules run the following command:

bc. git clone -b demo --recursive git://github.com/danielctull/DCTTableViewDataSources.git

When changing to the demo branch you will need to run through the following set of commands:

bc. git checkout demo
git submodule init
git submodule update

After these you will see the example project and the library code will be in a sub-directory.

h3. Artefacts

Sometimes, there may be artefacts left over when switching from demo to master. These are files that are ignored by git and are easily cleaned up by running

bc. git clean -dxf
