h2. Features

h3. FGYController

FGYController is the main view controller that displays the iPod and click wheel. Its API is a simplified version of a UINavigationController. View controllers pushed will be resized to the size of the emulated iPod's display.

Click wheel events are delievered to the top-most view controller, using methods in the "FGYClickWheelDelegate":https://github.com/danielctull/Fourgy/blob/master/Fourgy/FGYClickWheel.h protocol.

h3. FGYTableViewController

This is a table view controller that will handle scrolling on the click wheel and display an iPod-looking scrollbar if the content is long enough.

h2. How to use

# Drag the Fourgy Xcode project into your app project
# Link against the Fourgy static library
# Copy the Fourgy.bundle into the application's bundle
